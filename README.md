# Airline-delay-cause
This project involves predicting weather-related airline delays using deep learning techniques.
The dataset used includes various features related to airline delays,
which are processed and analyzed to build a predictive model.

Key Steps:
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
.Loaded dataset from a CSV file.
.Dropped irrelevant and high-frequency columns.
.Removed outliers and handled missing values.

Feature Engineering:
.Created binary features for weather delays.
.Normalized features for model training.


Model Building:
.Built a neural network using Keras with multiple layers and dropout for regularization.
.Compiled the model with AdamW optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

Training and Evaluation:
.Trained the model with early stopping based on validation accuracy.
.Evaluated model performance using accuracy, loss metrics, and confusion matrix.

Results:
.Visualized training history and performance metrics.
.Generated classification reports to assess model effectiveness.

Requirements:
TensorFlow
Keras
Pandas
NumPy
